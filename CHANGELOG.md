## [1.0.1-beta.0](https://github.com/moeen-mahmud/react-native-floating-tab/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.1-beta.0) (2024-10-06)

### Release Notes

First beta release of the library. This release includes the following components and features. `react-native-floating-tab` is a collection of pre-made tab components for React Native applications created using expo modules. Supports both Android and iOS platforms with Expo SDK `51` and above. Note that the styles and look of the components are not highly customizable yet. But it works like a bread and butter if you use `expo-router` (which is mainly a wrapper around `react-navigation`). However, it will also work with `react-navigation` if you are using it in your project. Just add any of the component into the `tabbar props`, just like you would do with your customized tab bar. Uses high amount of spring animations provide a smooth and interactive user experience. The components are highly optimized for performance and are tested on both Android and iOS platforms.

>Please note that this is a beta release and may contain bugs. A report and a fix for any bugs found will be highly appreciated.
